# An-Cockrell Reimplementation 

A reimplementation in python of the NetLogo model from "Comparative Computational Modeling of the Bat and Human Immune Response to Viral Infection with the Comparative Biology Immune Agent Based Model" https://doi.org/10.3390/v13081620 The original docs for their NetLogo implementation of this model are in `an_cockrell/ORIG_DOCS.md`.

See the jupyter notebook for details on running the model. 


The file `an-cockrell-runner.py` runs latin hypercube sampling for the purposes of sensitivity analysis. The file `slurm-job.sh` is used to run this same script on HiPerGator.
